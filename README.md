This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs. The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fails to handle non-numeric user IDs, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, showcasing best practices for handling invalid inputs.
